Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt seem to be colluding to defraud the house. All 13 times there were losses incurred during an hour timeslot on the dates 3/10, 3/12, and 3/15, Billy was the dealer at the roulette table and Mylie was the bettor. Furthermore, Mylie was the only player recorded at the roulette table for more than a single one hour timeslot. Finally, the losses all occurred at the same times over those three days, save for the final 11pm timeslot on 3/15: 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm, and 11pm.
